## ‚öíÔ∏è Main Process :

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Wrangling & Python Analyst

## Task 1: Top 3 product_ids with the highest volume.

- Goal: Determine which products generate the highest transaction volume within the e-wallet ecosystem. This helps the company prioritize partnerships, allocate promotional budgets, and design targeted marketing campaigns to maximize transaction value.

-Approach

+ Group data by Product_id and sum the weight using groupby() and sum() methods.

+ Sort results in descending order using sort_values(ascending=False

+ Get the first 3 rows using head(3).

## Task 2: Given that 1 product_id is only owed by 1 team, are there any abnormal products against this rule?

- Goal: Identify if there are any products that violate the rule where each product_id is only owned by one team

-Approach

+ Initialize Tracking: abnormal_products list stores violating product_ids.

+ Identify Unique Products: df['product_id'].unique() extracts distinct product_id values to check.

+ Check Team Ownership: For each product_id, collect its unique team_own values using unique(). If a product_id has more than 1 team (len(teams) != 1), it‚Äôs added to abnormal_products.

+ Return Clear Results: Returns a list of violating IDs or confirms compliance.

<img width="581" height="32" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86029000-bb14-4ded-aabf-e07dd6b77567" />

## Task 3: Find the team has had the lowest performance (lowest volume) since Q2.2023. Find the category that contributes the least to that team.

- Goal: Identify the lowest performing business groups from Q2 2023 and find the product portfolio that contributed least to that performance, to support strategic management of improvements or renewable energy sources.

- Approach:

+ Filter Data for Q2 2023: df['report_month'] >= '2023-04' isolates records from April 2023 onward (Q2 starts in April).

+ Identify Weakest Team: groupby('team_own')['volume'].sum() calculates total volume per team. idxmin() returns the team with the lowest summed volume.

+ Find Weakest Category in Weakest Team: Filters data for the weakest team (team_data). Groups by category and sums volume to find the least productive category (idxmin()).

+ Return Results: Prints the team and category names for clarity. Returns both values for further analysis.

## Task 4: Find the contribution of source_ids of refund transactions (payment_group = ‚Äòrefund‚Äô), what is the source_id with the highest contribution?

- Goal :Determine which refund source (identified by source_id) contributes the most to the total refund amount, so that the business can prioritize investigation into its causes and implement targeted strategies to reduce refund losses.

- Approach:

+ Filter Refund Transactions: df[df['payment_group'] == 'refund'] isolates refund records.

+ Aggregate Refund Volume by Source: groupby('source_id')['volume'].sum() calculates total refund volume per source_id.

+ Identify Top Contributor: idxmax() returns the source_id with the highest refund volume. max() returns the exact contribution value.

+ Return Results: Prints the top source_id and its contribution for quick insights. Returns both values for further analysis (e.g., root-cause investigation).

## Task 5: Define type of transactions (‚Äòtransaction_type‚Äô) for each row, given:

+ transType = 2 & merchant_id = 1205: Bank Transfer Transaction

+ transType = 2 & merchant_id = 2260: Withdraw Money Transaction

+ transType = 2 & merchant_id = 2270: Top Up Money Transaction

+ transType = 2 & others merchant_id: Payment Transaction

+ transType = 8, merchant_id = 2250: Transfer Money Transaction

+ transType = 8 & others merchant_id: Split Bill Transaction

+ Remained cases are invalid transactions

- Goal:

  Classify all corporate e-wallet transactions by type (Bank Transfer, Withdrawal, Deposit, Payment, Transfer, Bill Split, Invalid) to:
+ Support the operations department to accurately track each type of transaction.

+ Detect invalid (invalid) transactions for timely processing or blocking

+ Provide input data for performance analysis by transaction type, thereby optimizing resources and business strategies

- Approach:

+ Rule-Based Classification:

transType = 2:

merchant_id = 1205 ‚Üí Bank Transfer

merchant_id = 2260 ‚Üí Withdraw Money (Note: Your code uses 2270 but the docstring says 2260; adjust as needed)

merchant_id = 2270 ‚Üí Top Up Money

All others ‚Üí Payment Transaction

transType = 8:

merchant_id = 2250 ‚Üí Transfer Money

All others ‚Üí Split Bill

All other transType values: Marked as "Invalid Transaction"

Application to DataFrame: Uses apply(define_transaction_type, axis=1) to process each row. Creates a new column transaction_type with the classified labels

Validation :Df_transactions.head() previews the results for verification

<img width="1209" height="349" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d7da148-13e4-422b-924c-008e7189d24d" />

<img width="1054" height="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa453d9b-4914-4b4b-8d52-7bae70a97aa7" />

## Task 6: Of each transaction type (excluding invalid transactions): find the number of transactions, volume, senders and receivers.

- Goal:
Determine the performance and popularity of each valid transaction type (excluding invalid transactions) to:

+ Evaluate which transaction types account for a large proportion in terms of quantity and value

+ Identify customer behavior based on the number of senders and recipients.

+ Support the optimization of transaction processing infrastructure and design appropriate service packages for key customer groups

-Approach:

+ Filter Valid Transactions: Excludes rows where transaction_type = 'Invalid Transaction'.

+ Aggregate Metrics:

num_transactions: Counts occurrences of each transaction type.

volume: Sums the volume column per type.

senders & receivers: Counts unique sender_id and receiver_id values using nunique

+ Return Structured Summary: Returns a DataFrame with transaction types as indices and aggregated metrics as columns.

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

- Final Conclusion

After analyzing transaction data across payment groups, channels, and customer segments, several key findings emerged:

‚úîÔ∏èRefunds Concentrated in Specific Source IDs

Source ID 38 accounts for the highest refund amount, totaling $36,527,454,759. This concentration suggests potential operational, product, or partner-related issues tied to this specific source.

‚úîÔ∏èHigh Transaction Volume from Certain Payment Channels

A few channels dominate transaction counts and values, indicating strong customer adoption but also potential risk if over-reliance is not managed.

‚úîÔ∏èSeasonal and Monthly Transaction Patterns

Fluctuations in transaction activity point to seasonal campaigns, promotional periods, or market behavior trends.

‚úîÔ∏èCustomer Behavior Segmentation Insights

Distinct patterns emerge among frequent users, high-value users, and refund-prone customers, allowing for targeted retention and risk management strategies.

‚úîÔ∏èRevenue Impact from Refunds

Refund transactions are not only operationally costly but also have a measurable impact on monthly revenue, requiring tighter control and monitoring.
Automate invalid transaction alerts for real-time resolution

üìå Recommendations:

‚úîÔ∏èInvestigate High-Refund Source IDs

Conduct an in-depth audit of Source ID 38 to identify root causes (e.g., merchant disputes, technical errors, fraud).

Implement stricter quality checks, partner performance reviews, and contractual refund penalty clauses if applicable.

‚úîÔ∏èDiversify Payment Channel Dependence

Encourage customer adoption of underutilized but secure and cost-effective payment channels.

Offer channel-specific incentives to balance transaction flow.

‚úîÔ∏èSeasonal Strategy Optimization

Align marketing campaigns with observed transaction peaks to maximize revenue.

Introduce targeted promotions during off-peak months to smooth revenue seasonality.

‚úîÔ∏èCustomer Retention & Risk Segmentation

Reward loyal and high-value users through exclusive perks, cashback offers, or tier-based rewards.

Closely monitor high refund-rate users and apply stricter refund validation.

‚úîÔ∏èRefund Reduction Initiatives

Enhance transaction verification processes before settlement.

Introduce a tiered refund approval process for high-value transactions.

Launch customer education campaigns on transaction confirmation steps to reduce accidental refunds.
